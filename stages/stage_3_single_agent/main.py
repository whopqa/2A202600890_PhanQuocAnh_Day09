"""Stage 3: Single Agent (ReAct Loop)

Wraps the LLM + tools in an autonomous agent that can reason, act,
and observe in a loop. The agent decides which tools to call, evaluates
the results, and may call more tools before giving a final answer.

Uses LangGraph's create_react_agent for the Think -> Act -> Observe loop.
